        <p>
          The Gokarnanatheshwara Temple, also known as Kudroli Sri Gokarnanatha
          Kshetra, is located in the Kudroli area of Mangalore, Karnataka,
          India. This temple holds significant religious, cultural, and
          historical importance, especially for the Billava community.
          <br />

          Consecrated by Shri Narayana Guru and built in 1912 by Adhyaksha
          HoigeBazar Koragappa, the temple is dedicated to Gokarnanatha, a form
          of Lord Shiva. It is recognized as "Aadi" by the Billava community,
          who are indigenous to the Western Ghats and the Western Coast of
          Karnataka. <br />

          The Billavas have a rich history linked to the ancient Chera Empire,
          which existed around 200 BCE to 1100 CE. The Chera kings, known as
          Villavar (Billava), united various clans to form the early Chera
          Empire along the western coast and Western Ghats of South India. The
          early Cheras were centered around Muziris, identified as the region
          around Mangalore. The kingdom's emblem featured a bow and arrow
          (Billu/Villu and Bana), and silver punch-marked coins with this symbol
          have been discovered, linking them to the term Billavas. The influence
          of other sects, such as the Nagas and Jains, brought about cultural
          changes like Naga worship and the construction of Jain monasteries.
          The rise of other empires, such as the Pandyas and Cholas, led to the
          gradual decline of the Chera Empire starting in the 5th century CE.
          The temple is situated 2 km from the center of Mangalore city. It
          features a Gopuram (tower-like structure) adorned with murals
          depicting various gods, goddesses, and scenes from Hindu epics and
          legends. These artistic elements illustrate the rich mythological and
          cultural heritage associated with Hinduism. In 1908, Adhyaksha
          Koragappa, a prominent Billava leader and businessman, led a
          delegation of Billava elders to invite Shri Narayana Guru to guide
          them in building a temple. Koragappa, a great devotee of Shri Narayana
          Guru and Bhagawan Nityananda of Ganeshpuri, owned a large tile factory
          and engaged in extensive trade with the Middle East, Africa,
          Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar. Upon Shri Narayana Guru's
          arrival in Mangalore, Koragappa provided him with a horse-drawn
          carriage to select a suitable location for the temple. Narayana Guru
          chose Kudroli after considering Mulihithilu, where a lot of Linga
          Roopa Aradhana (worship of the linga form of Shiva) used to happen,
          especially by saints of the NATH tradition. The Koragappa family still
          preserves the chair on which Shri Narayana Guru sat in Adhyaksha
          Koragappa's house to address various issues, including the creation of
          the temple. Adhyaksha Koragappa then donated the necessary land and
          funds to build the temple in 1912, seeking the blessings and spiritual
          guidance of Shri Narayana Guru, who himself brought the Shiva linga
          for the temple. The Gokarnanatheshwara Temple stands as a testament to
          the spiritual aspirations and cultural heritage of the Billava
          community. It continues to be a vibrant center of worship and a symbol
          of the enduring legacy of Shri Narayana Guru and Adhyaksha Koragappa.

        <br />
        <p>
          The Billavas are the indigenous people of the Western Ghats and the
          Western Coast of Karnataka. The first known empire of the Billavas was
          the Chera Empire, which existed around 200 BCE. The Chera kings of the
          Chera dynasty (200 BCE - 1100 CE) bore the title of Villavar
          (Billava). Several Villavar/Billava clans united to form the early
          Chera Empire along the western coast and Western Ghats of South India.
          The early Cheras were centered around Muziris, identified as the
          region around Mangalore in southwestern Karnataka. The Chera Kingdom's
          emblem featured a bow and arrow (Billu/Villu and Bana) on their flags,
          and silver punch-marked coins with the bow symbol have been
          discovered, linking them to the term Billavas. The influence of other
          sects, such as the Nagas and Jains, brought about cultural changes
          like Naga worship and the construction of Jain monasteries. The rise
          of other empires, such as the Pandyas and Cholas, led to the gradual
          decline of the Chera Empire starting in the 5th century CE. The Chera
          Empire is briefly mentioned by Kautilya (Chanakya) (3rd-4th century
          BCE), Katyayana (3rd-4th century BCE), and Patanjali (5th century
          BCE), among others. The Billava community sought to establish a unique
          spiritual presence, desiring to offer personalized worship to their
          deity, Lord Shiva, in accordance with Billava traditions. In this
          context, Adhyaksha Koragappa, a Billava leader and businessman, took
          the initiative to find a spiritual guide for this quest. In 1908,
          Adhyaksha Koragappa led a delegation of Billava elders to invite Shri
          Narayana Guru to guide them in building a temple. Adhyaksha Koragappa,
          a great devotee of Shri Narayana Guru and Bhagawan Nityananda of
          Ganeshpuri, was a prominent businessman in Mangalore. He owned a large
          tile factory and engaged in extensive trade with the Middle East,
          Africa, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, dealing in
          Mangalore tiles, copra, spices, and other natural products. Upon Shri
          Narayana Guru's arrival in Mangalore, Adhyaksha Koragappa provided him
          with a horse-drawn carriage to select a suitable location for the
          temple. After considering Mulihithilu and Kudroli, Narayana Guru chose
          Kudroli. The Koragappa family still preserves the chair on which Shri
          Narayana Guru sat in Adhyaksha Koragappa's house to address various
          issues, including the creation of the temple. Adhyaksha Koragappa then
          donated the necessary land and funds to build the temple in 1912,
          seeking the blessings and spiritual guidance of Shri Narayana Guru,
          who himself brought the Shiva linga for the temple.
